# Epic and User Stories

## Epic Story
Epic Story - Big chunk of work that can be divided into small user stories and can be split over multiple sprints and can be a high-level description of what the client wants. Scope is changeable over time and helpful to organise work and create a hierarchy. It allows us to break work into shippable pieces to ship value to customers on a regular basis and helps teams break work down while working towards bigger goals

Can be broken down in three main ways:
- Workflow breakdown
- Role-based breakdown
- Break down around the timeline
