# Epic and User Stories
This git will explore Epic and User stories and how they fit with Agile and SCRUM.

## Epic Story
Epic Story - Big chunk of work that can be divided into small user stories and can be split over multiple sprints and can be a high-level description of what the client wants. Scope is changeable over time and helpful to organise work and create a hierarchy. It allows us to break work into shippable pieces to ship value to customers on a regular basis and helps teams break work down while working towards bigger goals

Can be broken down in three main ways:
- Workflow breakdown
- Role-based breakdown
- Break down around the timeline

## User Story
User Story - are simple descriptions of a feature or function which is told from the point of view of the person who desires the new capability. Often these user stories are users or customers of the product.

Detail is added to user stories in two main ways:
- Splitting  the user stories into multiple but smaller user stories
- Adding more conditions

## User Story Benefits:
- Stories keep the focus on the user. A To Do list keeps the team focused on tasks that need checked off, but a collection of stories keeps the team focused on solving problems for real users. 
- Stories enable collaboration. With the end goal defined, the team can work together to decide how best to serve the user and meet that goal.
- Stories drive creative solutions. Stories encourage the team to think critically and creatively about how to best solve for an end goal.
- Stories create momentum. With each passing story the development team enjoys a small challenges and a small win, driving momentum.

## How Do Epic and User Stories Fit With Agile and Scrum
### Epic Stories (Agile)
- An agile epic is a body of work that can be broken down into specific tasks (called user stories) based on the needs/requests of customers or end users. 

### Epic Stories (SCRUM)
- In the context of a SCRUM, an epic is a user story which is too big to fit in one sprint

### User Stories (Agile)
- In agile, user stories allow for the software development team to put the users story and feedback at the centre of the conversation which will allow the team to know what to change in the development cycle.

### User Stories (SCRUM)
- In SCRUM, user stories are added within sprints are periodically resolves over the sprint.
