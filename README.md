# Epic and User Stories
This git will explore Epic and User stories and how they fit with Agile and SCRUM.
## Epic Story
Epic Story - Big chunk of work that can be divided into small user stories and can be split over multiple sprints and can be a high-level description of what the client wants. Scope is changeable over time and helpful to organise work and create a hierarchy. It allows us to break work into shippable pieces to ship value to customers on a regular basis and helps teams break work down while working towards bigger goals

Can be broken down in three main ways:
- Workflow breakdown
- Role-based breakdown
- Break down around the timeline

## User Story
User Story - are simple descriptions of a feature or function which is told from the point of view of the person who desires the new capability. Often these user stories are users or customers of the product.

Detail is added to user stories in two main ways:
- Splitting  the user stories into multiple but smaller user stories
- Adding more conditions
